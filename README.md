## Simple Task Manger by Hrushi0d

For this project to function you need to create a firebase project and app and then Store your firebase SDK Keys into a .env file.

```bash
        VITE_API_KEY=
        VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
        VITE_PROJECT_ID=
        VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
        VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
        VITE_APP_ID=1:
        VITE_MEASUREMENT_ID=

        ```

After that you just need to install all the dependencies.

    ```bash
        cd frontend/
        npm install
        ```

After that you can run it with npm run dev

    ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
